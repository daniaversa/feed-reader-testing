# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 4 - Feed Reader Testing

This project is based on test-driven programming practices and the idea is to implement several tests using Jasmine.

## Tests

The tests makes sure:
- _(Pre-Implemented)_ Rss feeds are defined.
- Rss feeds have valid URLs defined.
- Rss feeds have valid names defined.
- The menu is hidden by default.
- The menu visibility toggles when button is clicked.
- Initial entries exist and are valid.
- New feed selection changes content properly.

## Instructions

To run the app, download the repository as a zip-file and open the 'index.html' file. The tests should be on the bottom of the page.
